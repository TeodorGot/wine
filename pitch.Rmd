###Problems with the choice of wine?
![wine-choose](wine-red-wine.jpg)

## My app can help you to decide:
By logistic regression app help to decide which wine to choose. The app uses only terms that are understandable to the customer:
      
* Alcohol - defined as amount of alcohol by volume
* Residual sugar - refers to any natural grape sugars that are left over after the ceasing of fermantation regardless if they are in purpose or not
```{r}
summary(log.model)
```


## About dataset:
More than 6000 observation of wine with 13 variables. App choose only two! data from :
[MLD](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/)
```{r echo = TRUE}
str(wine)
```

## EDA 1
Histogram of alcohol from the wine data. Color by red and white wines.
```{r echo=FALSE}
pl <- ggplot(wine,aes(x=alcohol)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill=label),color='black',bins=50)
pl + scale_fill_manual(values = c('#ae4554','#faf7ea')) + theme_bw()
```

## EDA 2
Histogram of residual sugar from the wine data. Color by red and white wines.
```{r echo=FALSE}
pl <- ggplot(wine,aes(x=residual.sugar)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill=label),color='black',bins=50)
pl + scale_fill_manual(values = c('#ae4554','#faf7ea')) + theme_bw()
```
